                    August 29, 2021: US drone strikes killed a wrong person (and 7 children) because they used heat detection cameras/software to identify the target in Kabul, Afghanistan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The US said that a Reaper drone followed a car for hours, finally firing once it had sufficient evidence that the vehicle contained explosives. There is significant reason to doubt this account, with details having been uncovered in a New York Times investigation of both video evidence and interviews with civilians.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This strike is the last known missile fired by the US in Afghanistan. Yet evidence led the Times to question whether explosives were present in the vehicle and even whether the driver had a connection to ISIS in the first place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though the military did not know the driver’s identity when they fired the drone, he was later identified as a man by the name of Zemari Ahmadi, who had done work for a US aid group for years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What the Times and the military say happened varies greatly. The military says Ahmadi possibly visited an ISIS safe house. The Times interviews suggest he was taking friends to and from work. The military said they thought he loaded explosives into his car. The Times video analysis suggests that Ahmadi and his friend were loading water into his trunk to bring home to his family. The military reported a second shock blast occurred due to explosives in the car. Video analysis from the Times showed that this was not the case. The military reported the death of three civilians. Times reporting confirmed ten deaths, including seven children.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How did the US military make the assumptions that would lead to these deaths?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Surveillance of the Ahmadi’s vehicle began when he left his home for work in the morning, as it was supposedly spotted leaving a compound identified as an ISIS safe house. There is some speculation that Ahmadi’s vehicle may have been confused with another car of the same make and model, that would launch a rocket attack the following morning. The location of that vehicle was close to where Ahmadi’s friend was picked up on the way to work. The US military later admitted their mistake, saying, “We just didn't pick up the Toyota Corolla that we believe we should have picked up.” Regardless, the drone tracked Ahmadi throughout the day. Every move that Ahmadi made seemed to confirm the military’s suspicions. He made several stops. After picking up his passengers, he picked up breakfast and went to work. Later that day, Ahmadi and his passengers visited a Taliban-occupied police station, where they said they requested permission to distribute food to refugees. They then went back to the office. A while later, Ahmadi was filmed filling up water containers and putting them in his trunk. Apparently, water was tough to come by as the Taliban had advanced. US officials stated that the drone observed heavy packages being loaded into the vehicle that they assumed to be explosives. Later, in a separate statement, they said that they had suspected the computer bag contained explosives: "As it turns out, and we can affirm it, it was a computer bag" and not explosives, said Lt Gen Said.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Ahmadi drove home, the drone notified officials that he was getting closer to the airport. Military officials, fearing an attack, decided to fire the strike. This is despite the fact that the car was now in a densely populated residential area. A “reasonable certainty” had been determined that there were no civilians in danger. How was this assessed? Apparently, only one person was near the car at the moment that they made the decision. However, more family members came out to greet Ahmadi. Many of them died.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This instance highlights how confirmation bias in the military allows its members to make judgment calls that are not necessarily sound, and can forever impact those who are targeted. Despite these incorrect judgment calls and confirmation biases, the Pentagon determined that no laws were broken.
