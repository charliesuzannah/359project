            <strong>Tower Bridge</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tower Bridge is a Grade 1 listed combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineering by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel.
            It crosses the River Thames and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust founded in 1282.
            The bridge was constructed to give better access to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century.
            The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213 foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that open to allow shipping.

           <strong>Big Ben</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, England, and the name is frequently extended to refer also to the clock and the clock tower.
            The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.
            When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 316 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps.
            All four nations of the UK are represented on the tower on shields featuring a rose for England, thistle for Scotland, shamrock for Ireland, and leek for Wales. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary.

            <strong>St. Paul's Cathedral</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London and is the seat of the Bishop of London. The cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. 
            It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade 1 listed building.
            Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604.
            The cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. 
            At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world.
