                    September 23, 2018: Mullah Hafiz, Afghanistan air strike.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The US military bombed the home of Masih Ur-Rahman Mubarez in an air strike, killing his wife, his seven children, and four cousins (also children). They did this while conducting a raid on the Taliban nearby. However, in the aftermath of the strike, the US repeatedly denied that they had carried out the bombed the house, or that an air strike had taken place in that location. Upon investigation from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and various collaborators using satellite imagery, photos, and other sources the military finally admitted that this strike did take place. However, it still denies that its actions resulted in civilian deaths.

                    The Afghan forces would not respond for comment. Initially, in October, a US spokesperson stated there were “no connections” between their actions and allegations of civilian casualties. Later, in February, they said that there had been no strike at all on the date in question. A report released by the Pentagon subsequently did not list Masih’s house on the list of confirmed civilian casualties.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the story was about to go to press, the Pentagon finally admitted that they had bombed the house. However, they denied any civilian casualties. They stated that soldiers had been fired on from the house, and said the attack was in self defense without providing evidence of how this conclusion was reached.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    US forces rely on drone footage to tell whether an attack has harmed civilians. In this case, with a building having been the target, it is nearly impossible to tell from the air what is under the rubble.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These facts, all denied at various points by the US government, have been confirmed. 
                    <br>
                    1. A strike hit Masih’s house

                    <br>
                    2. The burial site for his family did not exist before September 23

                    <br>
                    3. Weapon fragments found at the site of the strike show “CAGE code,” a unique identifier for companies supplying US defense agencies. The specific weapon used was determined to be a JDAM missile, which was not in the possession of Afghan forces. The only other military forces conducting strikes in the vicinity was the US

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Multiple civilian reports say that there were no gunshots in the vicinity, putting into doubt the US’s claims of self-defense. The other possibility for why this attack occurred is that it was an accident, as the home was close to the Taliban prison.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This incident shows the lack of accountability around civilian deaths, and how easy it is for countries to hit the wrong location.
